# This is Day 3 project 3 of the 50 projects in 50 days attempt

I've been pushing my commits to the master branch and this is the main branch for most of my projects in this course unless otherwise stated. This project in particular has me manipulating the webpage using the navigation. This involves heavy css and some JS. This may be something I implement in further solo projects.
